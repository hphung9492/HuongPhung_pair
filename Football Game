Loop,Methods,Arrays for Football


In this program, we will build a class that will simulate a football game.
The program will prompt the user to enter the names for two teams.

The user will then be asked to enter the score each time a team scores.

Scores must be validated according to the following rules.

Scores of 2, 3 and 6 are allowed as the initial entry for a score.

A score of 1 is only allowed if the previous score was a 6 by the
same team and in the same quarter.

Scores must be entered in a method and the user should be prompted for
the quarter and the score. Once a user has moved to a new quarter,
they are not allowed to enter scores for a previous quarter.

At the end of the 4th quarter, the scores will be totaled and displayed
to the user. You must use a method to total the scores and determine the winner.
The winning team will then be printed along with the scores.  This must be done
in a separate method.

This program requires the use instance variables.
You will have at least 2 String variables for team names, one or two int arrays
to hold the quarter scores.

You are allowed to use the key word static once in this program.
