Great job, Huong!
This time you will develop the second version.
This time you will revise this program based on the followings.

1) create a quarter-arrays for each team. This array's length is 4.
    each element of the quarter will store the total scores earned

2) use ArrayList<Integer> to add scores for each quarter. Once the user enters the
Next quarter, it will stop adding scores to the previous quarter.
3) you will need to total all scores entered then you will add that score to the
The array above(1).

Keep the rule the same, but this time you will use Arrays and ArrayList<Integer>
